# Virtualized Help Desk Environment Setup

In this repository, I will be explaining the steps to making a virtualized help desk using foundational knowledge of networking and operating systems. There will be a detailed guide on setting up two virtual machines —one running Windows 10 and one running Ubuntu — using VirtualBox, a Type 2 hypervisor. There will also be documentation showing how I set up static IP addresses and tested connectivity between the two machines. Finally, there will be a documented process for hardening both VMs like disabling unused services, enabling the firewall and setting strong user passwords.
