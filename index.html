    <h1>Virtualized Help Desk Environment Setup</h1>
    <p>
      The objective is to configure a client-side Type 2 Hypervisor using
      VirtualBox and deploy two networked Virtual Machines — one Windows and one
      Linux— to demonstrate core A+ skills, including virtualization, IP
      configuration, and basic security hardening.
    </p>
    <h3>Install and configure the hypervisor</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install a hypervisor onto your host operating system. In
        this case, we will use VirtualBox.
      </li>
      <li>
        Verify that Hardware Assisted Virtualization is enabled in the host
        computer's BIOS/UEFI settings. Without this, the VMs will run poorly or
        not at all. A quick way to check is by opening Task Manager, going to
        the Performance tab, choose CPU and check if Virtualization is enabled.
      </li>

      <li>
        Download the ISO installation files for the two client operating
        systems. In this case, we will be using Windows 10 and Ubuntu.
      </li>
