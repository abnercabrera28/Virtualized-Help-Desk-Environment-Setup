    <h1>Virtualized Help Desk Environment Setup</h1>
    <p>
      The objective is to configure a client-side Type 2 Hypervisor using
      VirtualBox and deploy two networked Virtual Machines — one Windows and one
      Linux— to demonstrate core A+ skills, including virtualization, IP
      configuration, and basic security hardening.
    </p>
    <h3>Install and configure the hypervisor</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install a hypervisor onto your host operating system. In
        this case, we will use VirtualBox.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/virtual box.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Verify that Hardware Assisted Virtualization is enabled in the host
        computer's BIOS/UEFI settings. Without this, the VMs will run poorly or
        not at all. A quick way to check is by opening Task Manager, going to
        the Performance tab, choose CPU and check if Virtualization is enabled.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/task manager.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Download the ISO installation files for the two client operating
        systems. In this case, we will be using Windows 10 and Ubuntu.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Create and install the Virtual Machines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Launch VirtualBox and create two new virtual machines. For each one, I
        allocate at least 4GB of RAM and two CPU cores, and a sufficient virtual
        hard disk size. For this case, I used 50GB.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="/images/ram and cpu.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Mount the respective ISO file to each VM's virtual optical drive and
        power on the VM to begin the standard operating system installation
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the OS is installed on each VM, install the hypervisor's "Guest
        Additions". This is crucial as it installs necessary drivers for better
        performance, screen resolution, and smooth integration with the host
        machine.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/guest additions.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </ul>

    <h3>Configure Network Settings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Next we set both VMs' network adapters to NAT (Network Address
        Translation) network mode. In order to do this, we must create a network
        in VirtualBox. Then go to each VM's network settings and attach them to
        your created network. This allows both VMs to access the internet
        through the host's IP address while remaining isolated from the rest of
        my local area network.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img class="create-network" src="images/create network.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/NAT network.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        While DHCP is standard, I will manually set a static IP address on both
        VMs within the hypervisor's NAT network range. On both VMs, go to the
        network settings and set the IP address, subnet mask, and a default
        gateway.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/static IP windows.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/static IP linux.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Use the command prompt or Powershell in Windows and Terminal in Ubuntu
        to execute the
        <b>ping</b> command from one VM to the other to confirm direct internal
        communication. You could also use <b>ipconfig /all</b> in Windows and
        <b>ip a</b> in Ubuntu to verify the assigned IP addresses.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/pinging from windows.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/pinging from linux.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        If there are any problems with pinging between machines, check your
        firewall settings to make sure inbound echo requests are enabled.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/firewall inbound rule.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </ul>

    <h3>System Hardening and Security</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Immediately change the default usernames and passwords on both VMs to
        strong, complex passwords.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/password windows.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/password linux.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Run system updates on both operating systems to ensure all security
        patches are installed, minimizing vulnerabilities.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/updates windows.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/updates linux.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Verify that the firewalls are active on both VMs and configured to block
        non-essential incoming traffic.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/firewall on windows.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/firewall linux verbose.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Identify and disable unnecessary services that could be exploited like
        Telnet, if not required.
      </li>
      <div>
        <img src="images/telnet.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </ul>
